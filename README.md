# Members Only

> In this project, you'll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

This is a project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication?ref=lnav).

*Note: This is a work in progress.*
