# Menbaa

A tiny message board to practice authentication and autorization. This is a project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication?ref=lnav).

## Task

"In this project, you'll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it."

## Details

I decided to also add a sign up feature with a simple CAPTCHA, using the [Humanizer](https://github.com/kiskolabs/humanizer) gem, and an admin dashboard using the wonderful [Administrate](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate) gem from [Thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot).
